    "# Customer Churn Prediction for Beta Bank"

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon of customers leaving a company. It's a critical metric in many businesses, as it's often less expensive to retain existing customers than to attract new ones. Moreover, reducing customer churn is directly related to increasing customer lifetime value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are working with Beta Bank. The bank has been noticing an increase in customer churn rates. The bankers figured out it’s cheaper to save the existing customers rather than to attract new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been provided with a dataset containing data on clients’ past behavior and termination of contracts with the bank. Our task is to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon. The goal is to create a machine learning model to predict customer churn so that the bank can proactively address the issue and improve customer retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation:** Download and prepare the data. Explain the procedure.\n",
    "2. **Examine the balance of classes:** Check if our target variable 'Exited' is balanced or imbalanced. A class imbalance could affect the performance of our model.\n",
    "3. **Train the model without taking into account the imbalance:** We will first train our model without considering the possible class imbalance. This will serve as a baseline for comparison.\n",
    "4. **Improve the quality of the model:** If there is a class imbalance, we will use at least two approaches to fix it and improve the quality of our model. We will use the training set to pick the best parameters.\n",
    "5. **Perform the final testing:** Finally, we will evaluate the performance of our model on the test set."

    "## Data Preparation\n",
    "In this step, we will download and prepare the data for analysis. The data preparation process involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Downloading the data:** We will download the data from the provided URL.\n",
    "2. **Loading the data:** We will load the data into a pandas DataFrame, which is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. DataFrames are generally the most commonly used pandas object.\n",
    "3. **Inspecting the data:** We will inspect the data to understand its structure and the types of data it contains. This includes checking the number of rows and columns, the types of variables, and the number of missing values.\n",
    "4. **Handling missing values:** If there are any missing values in the data, we will decide how to handle them. This could involve removing rows or columns with missing values, or filling in the missing values with a specific value.\n",
    "5. **Encoding categorical variables:** If there are any categorical variables in the data, we will encode them. Machine learning models require input to be in numerical format, so we need to convert categorical variables into a suitable numerical format."

We first trained three models (logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest) without taking into account the imbalance. The models achieved F1 scores below the threshold of 0.59, indicating that they were not very effective at predicting the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the models, we used two approaches to fix the class imbalance: oversampling the minority class and undersampling the majority class. We then trained the models again with the balanced data. The models achieved higher F1 scores, indicating that they were more effective at predicting the minority class.\n",

    "We evaluated the models on the test set and computed the F1 score and the AUC-ROC score for each model. The F1 scores on the test set were lower than the F1 scores on the training set, which is expected as models usually perform worse on unseen data. However, the F1 scores were still above the threshold of 0.59, which was the goal of this project.\n",
